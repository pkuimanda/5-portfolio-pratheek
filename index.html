									<h2 class="major">My Ultimate Dream and Goals</h2>
									<p>When my grandparents passed away, I felt every source of motivation ripped away from me to accomplish something in my life. However, it paved a path for me and gave my life a sense of purpose to one day help thousands of families. I hope to one day become a cardiothoracic surgeon who can help families in developing countries have access to free surgeries and other healthcare amenities alike. When my grandfather passed away this school year, we had found out that the hospital had kept him in the ICU and ward much after he passed away, while they continued to extract more money out of us. When we found out, we were enraged, but there wasn't much we could do, due to the circumstances my family and extended family were in living in extended parts of the world. I am still thoroughly disgusted in the way the hospital acted and want to prevent such pain that other families are going through. Many hospitals around the world have begun to treat patients as if it were a business instead through pure, genuine, and humane care, which all the ideals of medicine for founded upon. My lifelong goal is to prevent heinous acts such as these and help better the world.
